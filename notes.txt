- Data Validations
    NO NEED

- Organize our code (separate HTML , CSS & JS)
    Ops team


Maintaining
    Fix bugs
    Introduce new features
    remove dead features
    optimize existing code

        => CHANGE

Separation of Concerns
    UI & NON UI


Reactive (Dumb) X Proactive (knowledge)


View Synchronization with the model
    1. Incremental
            - create the dom tree once and 
            - keep manipulating the same dom nodes again and again 
                for reflecting the model state changes

    2. All In One
            - recreate the dom (with the latest model state) 
                again and again for every model state change
            - becomes easier when used a template engine

            template + data => template engine => generated new content with data

    react.js
    react-dom.js

View in React = Component (Presentation + UI Behavior + UI State)
                    UI Behavior = Reacting to user actions

ES6 (ES2015, ESNext)

1. let
2. const
3. Array destructuring
4. rest operator (array)
5. spread operator (array)
6. Object destructuring
7. rest operator (Object)
8. spread operator (Object)
9. default arguments
10. arrow functions 
11. template strings
12. symbol
13. classes

HTML
Only open tags are allowed (eg., hr, br)
An attribute named "for" is allowed
An attribute named "class" is allowed

JSX
Every open tag must have a close tag (<hr/>, <br/>)
use "htmlFor" as an alternative for "for"
use "className" as an alternative for "class"

State Choices
    Model
        Any data that supports the CORE BUSINESS LOGIC ( and / or ) needed throughout the application

    Component (setState)
        localizing the data for that component
        Only that component (and its children) will be able to recognize when the state is changing

        To be used only to maintain any data that IS NOT NEEDED in other parts of the application
        ONLY UI STATE should be in the component state
